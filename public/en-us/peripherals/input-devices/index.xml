      <description>Here at WePC, we&amp;rsquo;ve had the privilege of testing over 50 mice in the quest to find the ultimate, all-round gaming mouse. Every mouse we recommend has been purchased, unpacked, and used extensively with various grip styles and within a selection of gaming genres. We are continually testing new mice to see whether they have what it takes to break into our very competitive best gaming mice list for 2020.</description>
