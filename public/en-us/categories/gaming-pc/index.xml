      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s be completely honest, a gaming PC for under $300 isn&amp;rsquo;t going to be the most amazing build. However if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a PC that&amp;rsquo;s capable of running your day to day tasks, and that allows you to play low intensive games like Fortnite, CS: GO and Overwatch this build we do. It will run most AAA games, although at lower resolution and graphical settings.
The good news you can take this entry level build as starting point, and extend it by adding a dedicated graphic card or by replacing the CPU with a more powerful model.</description>

      <description>It was a tough task putting a $300 custom build together, but thanks to AMD&amp;rsquo;s impressive range of APU&amp;rsquo;s, we were able to do so while still achieving good levels of performance. At the heart of this build sits AMD&amp;rsquo;s entry-level APU, the 2200G. It comes equipped with Vega 8 graphics, which are surprisingly good at handling low intensive games such as CS: GO and Fortnite.  Build Overview - Budget $300 PC Build Let&amp;rsquo;s quickly go over what this build has to offer in terms of performance and features, and while we&amp;rsquo;re at it, let&amp;rsquo;s discuss some of the roadblocks we encountered and why we ended up choosing the hardware we concluded with.</description>

      <title>Best Cheap Gaming PC Build Under $400</title>

      <description>Like with the $300 build it&amp;rsquo;s not an easy task to have a decent gaming PC for a $400 budget. This setup is comparable to the lower-end build, reusing many components, but adding some extra power. It still won&amp;rsquo;t be the most amazing build, but rest assured: it&amp;rsquo;s future proof. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty easy to extend this configuration by adding a graphics card or changing the processor. All parts were handpicked, from reliable brands and while they may not have all the feauters of their more expensive counterparts, they will do perfectly fine.</description>
