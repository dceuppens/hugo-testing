# Our Best Cheap Gaming PC Build Under $400 of 2020

It was a tough task putting a $300 custom build together, but thanks to AMD's impressive range of APU's, we were able to do so while still achieving good levels of performance. At the heart of this build sits AMD's entry-level APU, the 2200G. It comes equipped with Vega 8 graphics, which are surprisingly good at handling low intensive games such as CS: GO and Fortnite.

## Build Overview - Budget $300 PC Build

Let's quickly go over what this build has to offer in terms of performance and features, and while we're at it, let's discuss some of the roadblocks we encountered and why we ended up choosing the hardware we concluded with.

**Budget** - One of the main goals for the $300 custom build was to create a gaming PC that could handle AAA titles while remaining under budget. No easy task I'm sure you'll agree. However, thanks to the excellent value of AMD's APU range, we were able to achieve this goal by opting for their entry-level APU, the 2200G.

The 2200G was pretty much the only APU we could go for and remain under budget, but that wasn't a bad thing. By opting for an APU, we no longer had to worry about the cost of a standalone GPU. We had just unlocked a nice chunk of the budget, which could be used to bolster other areas of this build like RAM. We paired the 2200G with 16GB of 3400MHz RAM, which is exactly what this APU needs to run at optimal levels.

**Performance** - Let's be honest, you aren't buying this build if you're looking to play Farcry 5 in 4k/ultra settings. This build is tailored towards low-intensive games such as CS: GO, Fortnite, and Overwatch. The APU should be able to churn out 50+FPS on these games on low-medium settings.

**AMD APU's** - An APU, for those wondering, is an accelerated processing unit that comes with its own integrated graphics built-in. Unlike Intel CPUs, an AMD APU comes with VEGA graphics, which is much more powerful. The 2200G comes with VEGA 8 graphics that showcase similar performance levels to a GT 1030. So, not bad.

The integrated graphics of an APU fully depend on your system RAM when in use. For that reason, equipping your build with fast RAM is essential when trying to achieve maximum performance out of your APU.

## How We Choose the Parts

Our team has years of experience behind them building PCs for a range of needs and budgets. All this knowledge combined with hours of research, user feedback, and onsite benchmarking is what goes into choosing the best components for our builds.

We look for value for money, how the components perform together and focus on gamer’s needs to make sure our builds are the best your budget can buy.

We build all these PC’s ourselves, in house, so trust us when we say we want to make them as good as possible. We actually use all these builds ourselves day-to-day in the WePC offices.

## How We Test The PC Components

We build each of our selected PC’s from scratch to make sure all the parts we recommend work well together, fit into the selected case, and provide the best performance possible for the price range.

Once built, the PC’s are used in the office for everyday work as well as a range of games from light to heavy-duty. While we test, we also run benchmarking tests to see how well our builds perform, all while keeping an eye on the temperature of the components themselves. 

We tested our AMD builds against their Intel counterparts and found that these CPU’s performed better across the board, and for a lower price. This is why we only recommend an AMD version.
