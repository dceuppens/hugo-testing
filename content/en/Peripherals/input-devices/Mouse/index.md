Here at WePC, we've had the privilege of testing over 50 mice in the quest to find the ultimate, all-round gaming mouse. Every mouse we recommend has been purchased, unpacked, and used extensively with various grip styles and within a selection of gaming genres. We are continually testing new mice to see whether they have what it takes to break into our very competitive best gaming mice list for 2020.

After spending more than 15-20 hours using each of the different mice, we concluded that the Logitech G Pro is the best gaming mouse money can buy. Under the shell sits the HERO sensor which is essentially a more efficient PWM336x and it's housed inside one of the comfiest, fully ambidextrous shapes we have ever used.

If all this talk of grips, sensors, and ergonomics is a little confusing, don't worry, the following article is going to explain everything you need to know when looking to purchase a new mouse. Don't forget how crucial a great mouse pad is to gaming performance, be sure to check out our guide to the best mouse pads here.

Without further ado, let's have a little look at some of the contenders.

## How We Choose {class="content-body-label"}
{{< htmlclass "content-body-section"  >}}

The list above is a composition of 5 gaming mice that we consider as the best in their respective categories. Below we have outlined the most essential key points and features that will affect your decision when purchasing a new gaming mouse.

We choose our best gaming mice by testing each one - individually - under a series of pre-thought out scenarios which would ultimately give us the fairest, most accurate results in the end. The mice get tested in a number of different gaming genres and by gamers with their own specific gaming background.

## Best Gaming Mice: Key Points {class="content-body-label"}

{{< htmlclass "content-body-section" >}}

It's important to familiarise yourself with the key aspects of what makes a good gaming mouse a great one. These key features will not only affect the price of the mouse but, more importantly, your in-game performance. Whether you’re interested in buying a gaming mouse under $30 or a gaming mouse under $50 or you want the best of the best, knowing what to look for will always go a long way.

We found that the following are the most important factors when looking to purchase a gaming mouse:

### CPI or DPI

Technically speaking, CPI (Counts Per Inch) is the same as DPI (Dots Per Inch). As explained by [beebom](https://beebom.com/cpi-vs-dpi/).

DPI is used to measure the distance traveled by the mouse by counting the “dots” within the span of a one-inch space. DPI is better used in reference to the printing world and CPI is actually the correct term to use. 

Despite this, manufacturers use DPI for marketing purposes as DPI is more widely known.

### Size

When choosing a gaming mouse, choose one that fits your hand size. Depending on your grip, you can get away with a slightly bigger/smaller mouse, but it is worth measuring your hand and looking at comparisons to see if a mouse will fit your hand nicely.

We've split our mouse recommendations into three groups – small, medium and large hand sizes. Gaming mice are categorised based on the size of the mouse and general consensus regarding which size mouse will be most comfortable/effective for particular hand sizes.

I personally have a hand size of 19.5cm x 10cm which does seem quite common, so I personally find a medium to large mouse the most comfortable.

**Best gaming mice for small hands**

* Logitech G305[https://www.wepc.com/reviews/logitech-g305-wireless-mouse-review/]
* Logitech G Pro

**Note:** this is a work in progress, we have reviewed approximately 50 gaming mice so far, but we still have a long way to go to get any conclusive answer to the best gaming mouse and of course, it is completely based on personal preference. Fortunately for us though, we work as a team and create our recommendations as a team, based on our own personal feedback for each individual gaming mouse.

### Sensor

Gaming mice have two types of mouse sensors: **Optical** or **Laser**.

The main difference boils down to the illumination source. It’s also the reason why some mice work fine on smooth surfaces while others don’t. The optical sensor uses LED light as the source of illumination while the laser sensor uses, well… a laser.

Although they differ in terms of the illumination source, they both use a CMOS image sensor, a type of low-resolution video camera that you can find in smartphones. This image sensor captures images of the surface it's on and uses it to determine how movement reflects in real-time use.

The majority of modern gaming mice include good sensors such as the Pixart 3366; there are very few gaming mice with poor sensors on the market these days.


### Software and Profiles

Most gaming mice have some programmable buttons, but you are going to need Software that lets you re-map them. 

The vast majority of mice will come with software to help you assign macros, change your DPI, lift-off distance,  and in some cases customize your RGB lighting. Gamers now expect mouse software to save custom profiles for easy on the fly changes, custom polling rates and compatibility with both Windows and Mac OS.

Usually, an afterthought, the software which a particular mouse uses can be the difference between loving a mouse and simply liking a mouse. For example, SteelSeries mice on a whole are pretty good, but their software lacks the intuitiveness that competitors such as Logitech offers. In the case of the smaller brands such as Fnatic and HyperX, their software leaves a lot to be desired.

### Polling Rate

Polling rate is the rate of data transfer and response from the mouse to the computer. It is measured in hertz and ranges from 250Hz to 1000Hz.

A mouse with a 500Hz rate means that the computer receives updates about its position every two milliseconds. While 1000Hz is technically twice as fast at only 1ms, it's still very hard to determine the difference, especially to most average gamers. Despite not being able to see this difference, most gamers will prefer the more responsive 1MS unless they are saving battery while working.

### Weight

The weight might be a highly subjective part of a mouse, but it can greatly affect accuracy.

Weight is largely down to preference, and any gamer will eventually get used to the weight of a new mouse after a bit of usage. It's still a huge concern when shopping for a wireless gaming mouse though, the majority of wireless gaming mice are quite heavy due to the additional hardware the mouse includes for wireless connectivity and battery power. The wireless technology in gaming mice is being optimized with every passing day meaning it will only be a matter of time before most wireless mice are as light as wired ones. For example, take the Logitech G Pro, which only weighs in at 80 grams (that is lighter than a lot of wired mice).

### Material and Durability

A gaming mouse can be made out of plastic, metal, or even glass. Some mice could feature a matte-like coating and others a silky smooth plastic coating, so it's important to know your preferences on the material before you buy.

Durability and material usually go hand in hand but isn’t always the case, because it also depends on the manufacturer. You can see we have three Logitech mice in our roundup, and this is largely down to the brand's fantastic build quality.

It is also worth noting that mice are rated for the number of clicks they’re projected to perform before breaking. 

Regardless, if you want a durable gaming mouse, then you usually can’t go wrong with most premium options!

### Comfort
When it comes to comfort, there are a few key areas to look at as hand sizes and grip styles differ significantly from gamer to gamer. A mouse being comfortable is highly important whether you are using it for a short or long period of time. If you don't get a comfortable mouse this could negatively impact your gaming performance and even cause hand discomfort in rare cases.

### Battery Life (for wireless gaming mice)

The technology behind wireless gaming mice has gotten to the point where you can almost totally rely on a lot of different mice at e-sport level.  Gone are the days where lag plagues your gameplay, or your gaming comes to an end as you have to re-charge the extremely heavy battery.

Mice now come with a rechargeable lithium battery compared to affordable wireless mice such as the Logitech G305 which uses a single AA battery.

### Grip Styles

A player's grip style comes down to a number of different factors; hand size, comfort, mouse, and accuracy. There are three dominant grip styles, which include palm, claw, and fingertip. Each one is used by many gamers worldwide, so don't feel awkward if you don't use the same grip as your favorite gamer.

The three main types of mouse gripping:
* **Palm Grip** - A palm grip style is one where your entire hand is in contact and resting on the mouse. This kind of grip offers maximum stability and solid accuracy as well.
* **Claw Grip** - The claw grip is somewhat of a strange grip where your palm is in contact with the bottom of the mouse and the fingers and arched up over the buttons. This is a great grip for people playing FPS as it promotes reactions and accuracy.
* **Fingertip Grip** -This is an almost hybrid grip consisting of both the palm and claw grips. The hand hovers in the air with your fingertips being the old thing in contact with the mouse. Since your palm doesn’t rest on the mouse, this gives you the most precise control.

The Logitech G Pro is one of the best all-round wireless gaming mice available in 2019. Logitech spent two years working with E-sports pros when designing the mouse to make sure it was good enough for enthusiasts and pros alike.

Although the G Pro looks fairly modest and generic, it's ergonomic design has been so well designed that it is by far on the comfiest shapes we've tested. More importantly, however, is the sensor that Logitech has armed this mouse with. It's the HERO (High-Efficiency Rated Optical) sensor and is widely considered the best gaming sensor currently available.

One of the stand-out features of this mouse has to be its weight, or lack of should I say. Historically, wireless mice have always been heavier than wired ones thanks to the wireless technology it's built around. This being said, Logitech, thanks to the ever-advancing technological universe we live in, has managed to design a wireless mouse - equipped with the best sensor in the world - which weighs 80grams. It's one of the lightest mice on the market and our top pick respectively.

The materials are nothing short of superb and the craftsmanship is equally as impressive. It has the look of a classy mouse and has the performance to boot. Nothing about this mouse has disappointed me so far making it the first, and only, mouse to achieve this feat.

Pair the Logitech G Pro with the Powerplay Mousepad and you will never run out of battery. It makes use of Logitech's Lightspeed technology and can charge on the go without the use of a wire. I know, impressive. If you aren't looking to splash out on all the fancy extras then fear not, the G Pro has an cool 40 hour life time when fully charged.

Ultimately, if you're looking for the best mouse for gaming and everyday use, which has a pin-point accurate sensor, superb aesthetics, cool features, and is lightweight, then look no further. The G Pro is the one for you.

MMORPGs are loaded with tons of skills, abilities, and spells that require a super reliable mouse to play as efficiently as possible. This is where the Logitech G600 comes into the picture.

Aside from the fact that you can scroll horizontally with the mouse wheel, this has 18 more MMO-tuned buttons for a grand total of 40 button combinations.

The G-shift button is one of the more exciting of the buttons as it acts as your keyboard shift button and doubles the function of each programmable button (20). It's located on the right of the mouse where your ring and pinky finger sit and it can be re-assigned if you prefer.

On the left side of the mouse where you would normally find two thumb buttons, we find 12 which can all be completely re-programmed to whatever command you desire. The buttons are curved in such a way that makes them more ergonomic than your standard side buttons. The side buttons also feature RGB lighting which can be customized in LGS (Logitech Gaming Software) to notify you of a profile change. For example, red RGB is profile one, blue RGB is profile two. You get the idea, it's cool.

The right side of the mouse has a nice texture which promotes a more stable and tighter grip giving you more control when moving at pace. The overall shape accommodates for most playing styles and grips with the G-shift buttons being great to rest your unused fingers on.

While the Logitech G600 may have an aged laser sensor it is actually highly accurate and reliable, plus when you factor in the insanely low price it makes for a perfect MMO mouse.
