{{< htmlclass "content-body-section" >}}

Like with the [$300 build](/gaming-pc/budget-builds/best-gaming-pc-under-300/ "Gaming PC build under 300$") it's not an easy task to have a decent gaming PC for a $400 budget. This setup is comparable to the lower-end build, reusing many components, but adding some extra power. It still won't be the most amazing build, but rest assured: it's future proof. It's pretty easy to extend this configuration by adding a graphics card or changing the processor. All parts were handpicked, from reliable brands and while they may not have all the feauters of their more expensive counterparts, they will do perfectly fine. 

At the core of this build is the amazing AMD Ryzen 3 3200G, a CPU with an integrated in Graphics card. Combined with 16GB of fast RAM, this build is a real console killer.

## Build Considerations {class="content-body-label"}

{{< htmlclass "content-body-section"  >}}

Let's quickly go over what this build has to offer in terms of performance and features, and while we're at it, let's discuss some of the roadblocks we encountered and why we ended up choosing the hardware we concluded with.

**Budget** - Not going to lie, when you're building a gaming PC for this budget compromises have to be made. You can't have a dedicated Graphicds Card, but AMD's APU range offers excellent value for a low price. The other components were chosen in function of the APU. They offer solid performance for a pretty low price, and allow for future upgrades / extensions. 

**Performance** - You won't be able to play AAA games at maxed settings. You will have to play on lower to medium settings, with lower refresh rates. If you want to play games like Far Cry 5, Final Fantasy XV, The Witcher 3 and other CPU intensive games at high resolution this build is probably not for you. It will however run popular games like Fortnite, Apex Legends and Grand Theft Auto V (GTA 5)

**What is an APU** - An APU is a processor that has the CPU and the GPU on the same chip. AMD was the first to launch APU's. The last generation Ryzen APU offers 4 cores (no multi-threading though) and features excellent built-in graphics processing, given its price. One caveat however, to get the best performance out of your APU, you will need a sufficiently fast RAM.

## Build Details {class="content-body-label"}

Let's check each of the components used to build this budget 300 $ gaming system.

{{< htmlclass3 "content-body-section" >}} 
{{< markdowning >}} 
### CPU: AMD Ryzen 3200G Processor {class="icons-cpu"}
{{< /markdowning >}} 

{{< pclass "content-body-h3subtitle" >}}
Great performance for a great price
{{< /pclass >}}

{{< pclass "content-body-speclist" >}}
**Cores:** 4 | **Threads:** 4 | **Base Clock:** 3.6Ghz | **L3 Cache:** 4 MB | **TDP:** 65W | **PCIe lanes:** 8 
{{< /pclass >}}

{{< imgresponsive "amd-ryzen-3200g-detail" "AMD Ryzen 3200G" />}}

{{< body-summary-json  "Great value for price, Excellent Graphics processing, Integrated Cooling" "Might bottleneck future GPU's,No Overclocking" "0730143309851">}}

{{< markdowning >}} 
The Ryzen 3 3200G from AMD is currently the best choice for an entry level gaming PC. It's an affordable quad-core CPU with reasonably high clock speed. Thanks to the integrated Radeon Vega 8, it performs quite well for gaming, especially when paired with a fast enough RAM.

It's build on the same architecture as its predecessor (the Ryzen 2200G) but slightly faster. The price difference however is low, so I preferred to use the 3200G for this build.

### MOBO: Gigabyte B450M DS3H {class="icons-motherboard"}

{{< /markdowning >}}
{{< pclass "content-body-h3subtitle" >}}
A lot of value for an inexpensive board
{{< /pclass >}}

{{< pclass "content-body-speclist" >}}
**Sockets:** AM4 | **Case fan Headers :** 4-pins | **Form Factor:** Micro ATX | **Bios :** UEFI | **Memory :** 2x DDR4 - max 64GB |  **Card Interface :** 2x PCI-e 2.0 x1, PCI-e 3.0 x16

{{< imgresponsive "gigabyte-b450m-ds3h" "Gigabyte B450M DS3H" />}}

{{< body-summary-json  "4 Memory Slots, M.2 Slot, HDMI 2.0" "Only 2 fan connections , Audio quality, No USB 3.1" "4719331803827">}}

{{< markdowning >}} 

The B450M DS3H is stripped from all the bells and whistles of more expensive motherboards and provides value without sacrificing too much on the overall quality. The Realtek ALC887 audio codec does a decent job of providing onboard audio, but don't expect too much when it comes to sound. It is a great board for a cheap gaming PC build.

{{< markdowning >}} 

The SanDisk SSD Plus will not exactly blow you away with its performance, but it will be largely sufficient for this build. With 480GB will normally be enough for both gaming and daily tasks.

{{< markdowning >}} 

It's not the most fancy case, but it serves its purpose. It's big enought to fit all components, and cable management shouldn't pose any problem.

## What games can you play on this PC? {class="content-body-label"}

{{< htmlclass "content-body-section" >}}

This gaming built will meets the minimum requirements of the following games.   
* Counter-Strike: Global Offensive
* Dota 2 
* Fortnite
* Rocket League
* Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege
* PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds 
* Overwatch
* Warframe
* GTA V
* Forza Horizon 4 
* Monster Hunter: World
* Hitman 2 
* The Witcher 3
* Total War: Warhammer II
* PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds

Most of them can be played on 60FPS in 1080p - for Fortnite 100FPS should be easily achieved. Even more demanding titles like 'Monster Hunter: World' would still perform quite well at 60FPS. Contrary to our $300 build, PUBG becomes playable, although you really should not expect a good gaming experience. For better overall gaming performance, even for more demanding games you should check out the [$500 build](/gaming-pc/budget-builds/best-gaming-pc-under-500/ "Best Gaming PC build under $500")

## Prebuilt Gaming PC Under 400 Dollars {class="content-body-label"}

{{< htmlclass3 "content-body-section" >}}

If you're not really into building your own PC there are some pretty good prebuilt gaming PC options available. A prebuilt with similar specifications will be more expensive, but saves you the hassle (and the fun) of putting all parts together. It will work just fine out of the box.


{{< alternativebox "HP Pavillion Gaming Desktop" "hp_pavillion" "HP Pavillion" "$397.41" "#" "Check current price">}}
A great entry level gaming computer. You might want to upgrade the RAM though, 4GB is at the lower end.

### CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 3600 {class="icons-cpu"}
{{< /markdowning >}} 

{{< pclass "content-body-h3subtitle" >}}
Best All-Round Value CPU
{{< /pclass >}}

{{< pclass "content-body-speclist" >}}
**Cores:** 6 | **Threads:** 12 | **Base Clock:** 3.6 Ghz | **Boost Clock:** 4.2 Ghz |**L3 Cache:** 2x16 MB | **TDP:** 65W | **Socket:** AM4 |

{{< imgresponsive "amd-ryzen-5-3600" "AMD Ryzen 5 3600" />}}

{{< body-summary-json  "Cooler included, Overclocking , Quiet, Great value" "No integrated GPU" "0730143309936">}}

{{< markdowning >}} 
The AMD Ryzen 5 3600 offers a huge improvement on performance compared to the Ryzen 3 3200G. It's comparable to the Intel Core i5-9600K in terms of performance, but at a much lower price point. This upgrade comes with a caveat however: this CPU doesn't include a Graphics Card, so you will need to add one as well, increasing the total cost of this build. If you want top notch gaming performance on high-end AAA video games this CPU will be a choice you won't regret.

## Peripherals {class="content-body-label"}

Having a gaming PC is a nice start, but unfortunately the spending doesn't end there; If you want to run this system, you'll need a display, keyboard, mouse and an operating system. 

{{< htmlclass3 "content-body-section" >}} 

{{< markdowning >}} 
### Operating system: Windows 10 {class="icons-winos"}
{{< /markdowning >}} 

{{< pclass "content-body-h3subtitle" >}}
Still the most convenient and user-friendly OS for gaming
{{< /pclass >}}


{{< imgresponsive "windows10" ">Windows 10" />}}

{{< body-summary  "Loading time, Reliable , Directx 12 for high frame rates" "Annoying updates at inconvenient times" "$ 139" "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/b/windows" >}}

{{< markdowning >}} 
While Linux is a valid option, for most users Windows 10 is the best option. If you already have a licence on another PC you can transfer this licence to your new PC without issues. The licence shouldn't necessary be a Windows 10 licence, you can get a free upgrade on your Windows 7 or 8 licence.

If you're student, you can get a Windows 10 Educution licence for free. Even better it's yours to keep even if you graduate. Condition: You must be enrolled in an eligible school.

If you're on a very tight budget you can install Windows 10 and don't activate it. Main downside is a watermark in the bottom right of the corner. You won't be able to change Personalization options in the settings menu and you will obviously get no support from Windows in case of Problems.

Various resellers are selling Windows licences at prices much lower than the official price charged by Microsoft. Kinguin has multiple seller offering Windows Licences for as low as $ 29.99 . While they claim these licences are genuine, and are bought from wholesalers with a surplus of Licences, there is always a risk. Best option in that case is to add the Buyer protection to your purchase. It will cost you a bit more but it's 100% money back guarantee if the licence key isn't working.

Regardless via which channel you purchased your licence, if it's valid you're entitled to Microsoft Support in case of technical problems.

### Monitor: Asus VE228H {class="icons-monitor"}
{{< /markdowning >}} 

{{< pclass "content-body-h3subtitle" >}}
The best gaming monitor for less than $100
{{< /pclass >}}

{{< pclass "content-body-speclist" >}}
**Screen size:** 21.5" | **Resolution:** 1920 x 1080 | **Aspect Ratio:** 16:9 | **Response Time:** 5 ms | **Luminance:** 250 cd/&#13217; | **Built-in Speakers:** Yes | **Frame Sync:** No | **Viewing Angle:** 170°H x 160°V | **Connections:** HDMI (1) DVI (1) VGA (1)

{{< body-summary-json  "Great value for money, 60Hz refresh rate" "Don't expect too much from speakers, Colours could be more accurate" "0610839326068">}}

{{< markdowning >}} 
This Asus VE228H Gaming Monitor is a great entry-level 1080p monitor for an unbeatable price. The display quality is amazing, with great color contrast. Hardcore gamers would probably go for a 144Hz monitor, but for this build the 60Hz refresh rate will do just fine. The response time is 5ms is not best in class, but well enough for a 60Hz refresh rate. You will be able to play your favorite games without blurring or ghosting.

{{< markdowning >}} 
Ok - this is not a mechanical keyboard. But it is a great keyboard for its price: if feels great, key strokes are smooth are smooth and responsive. It has adjustable lighting patterns, 3 different profiles that allow customising for games. Looks nice, has good build quality, what more could you want for this price

{{< markdowning >}} 
A great affordable mouse. The 8000 DPI sensor is very accurate (and can be adjusted in increments of 50). It feels solid (although quite small if you have bigger hands). The ideal compnaion for this budget build.

### Sound: Creative Pebble  {class="icons-sound"}
{{< /markdowning >}} 

{{< pclass "content-body-h3subtitle" >}}
Tiny speakers with incredible sound

{{< body-summary-json  "Rich Sound, Incredible Price, Tiny Footprint" "No bluetooth" "0097855123152">}}

{{< markdowning >}} 
There is a lot of competition in the sub-30$ speaker range, but the Creative Pebble speakers really jump out. It has a full and balanced that normally only comes with speakers twice this price. As far as music is concerned, they can handle every style. But even for gaming they're surprisingly good. Ok, it's a 2.0 system, so you're not going to get a full surround effect, but they will just be fine for most of the games you play.

### Headset: HyperX Cloud Stinger {class="icons-headset"}
{{< /markdowning >}} 

{{< pclass "content-body-h3subtitle" >}}

{{< body-summary-json  "Unbeatable price, Very comfortable" "Microphone quality, Bass could be stronger" "0740617295467">}}

{{< markdowning >}} 
HyperX is one of the top Gaming Headsets manufacturers. Their entry-level model Cloud Stinger looks great but not really exceptional. While sound and microphone and not really top of class, they are extremely comfortable. Important as you'll be probably wearing them for a few hours while gaming. Sound is good in the mid-range but both bass and high-end could be a little bit more accentuated. The microphone will be do what's required, but it will not filter out all background noises and you voice may be a little deformed. Nothing your teammates will really complain about. Overall, best gaming headset in this pricerange.
