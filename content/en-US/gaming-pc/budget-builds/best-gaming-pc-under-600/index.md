## Build Considerations {class="content-body-label"}

{{< htmlclass "content-body-section"  >}}

The main goal of this build was to get the maximum gaming experience at 1080p. Let's quickly go over what this build has to offer in terms of performance and features, and while we're at it, let's discuss some of the roadblocks we encountered and why we ended up choosing the hardware we concluded with.

**Budget** - When selecting the different parts the most important criteria is to stick to the budget. Even with a more generous budget of $600 compromises need to be made. A large part of the budget was spend on the processor (the amazing AMD Ryzen 5 3600) and the Graphics Card (the equally great RX 570). We saved money by sticking to more budget components when it came to selecting the case and PSU. These parts don't really have an impact on gaming performance, so you will still have an amazing powerfull build within budget.

**Performance** - As mentioned before, the main goal of this build was to allow you to play all types of games, even the most graphically demanding ones at 60fps or more, on a 1080p monitor. With this build, you will have no problems with that. What's more, the architecture is future proof. Upgrading to newer (or better) processors, graphics cards will pose no problem whatsoever.

**AMD vs Intel** - Why did we choose AMD rather than Intel for this build. We have multiple reasons for that. First of all, Intel is still the more expensive of the two, an important consideration when you have to stick to a limited budget. AMD processors are overclockable and include a good cooler. Intels cooler is pretty flemsy and they charge a premium for overclocking. In terms of value, AMD is the clear winner. 

Second, from a performance standpoint, while Intel is still leading in the higher price ranges, for more budget builds like this the difference in performance between the two is quite limited. Our processor of choice is in fact more performant than it's more expensive Intel counter part.

Last point is upgradabiilty. AMD has made some smart choices regarding upgrades with their Socket AM4 motherboards, supporting both backward and forward compatibility, so you can reuse your motherboard when upgrading your processor.

## Build Details {class="content-body-label"}

Let's check each of the components used to build this budget 600 $ gaming system.

{{< htmlclass3 "content-body-section" >}} 
{{< markdowning >}} 
### CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 3600 Processor {class="icons-cpu"}
{{< /markdowning >}} 

{{< pclass "content-body-h3subtitle" >}}
Great value for a mid-range processor
{{< /pclass >}}

{{< pclass "content-body-speclist" >}}
**Cores:** 6 | **Threads:** 12 | **Base Clock:** 3.6Ghz | **Boost Clock:** 4.2Ghz |**L3 Cache:** 32 MB | **TDP:** 65W 
{{< /pclass >}}

{{< imgresponsive "amd-ryzen-5-3600-detail" "AMD Ryzen 5 3600" />}}

{{< body-summary-json  "Low Price, Excellent Gaming Performance, Integrated Cooling, Unlocked, PCIe 4.O support" "Limited Overclocking, No integrated Graphics Card, Needs more expensive motherboard" "0730143309936">}}

{{< markdowning >}} 
The Ryzen 5 3600 offers the best gaming performance you can buy for this budget. In terms of performance it beats the competing Intel Core i5-9600K, at a substantially lower price point. Overclocking is as simple as one click, and allows performance close to its more expensive brother, the Ryzen 5 3600x. You'll get 6 cores and 12 threads, the Ryzen 5 3600 is the true leader of PC gaming processors at an unrivaled price.

### GPU: XFX Radion Rx 570 {class="icons-gpu"}
{{< /markdowning >}} 

{{< pclass "content-body-h3subtitle" >}}
Incredible Performance for 1080p gaming
{{< /pclass >}}

{{< pclass "content-body-speclist" >}}
**Memory:** 8GB | **Core Clock:** 1168Mhz | **Boost Clock:** 1268 Mhz | **Frame Sync:** Freesync | **Length:** 246mm | **HDMI ports:** 1 | **DisplayPort ports:** 3 | **DVI ports:** 1 | **External Power:** 1 PCIe 8-pin | **Cooling:** 2 fans

{{< body-summary-json  "8GB GDDR5 VRAM, Overclocking , Quiet" "Power efficiency" "4719072548438">}}

{{< markdowning >}} 
At this price, there really is nothing that beats this Graphics card. It delivers excellent 1080p gaming performance at high frame rates, and even some decent 1440p frame rates. The technology is not really new, in fact it's a smaller update of the previous RX 470, but it still is one of the finest graphics cards you can buy today.

{{< body-summary-json  "No Bios upgrade required, M.2 Slot, HDMI 2.0" "Instructions not clear" "4719072665968">}}

{{< markdowning >}} 

While the motherboard is probably not the most important part for a gaming build, you can't really go wrong choosing this motherboard. For a price under $80, it comes with overclocking support and supports AMD CPU's from all generations (even the latest 3rd Gen CPU's are supported out of the box). You won't have issues upgrading your PC with this board. It allows up to 64 GB of RAM, and speeds up to 3466+Hz, so no issues here to find the ideal match for the Ryzen 5 3600 processor used in this build. It's not the best motherboard overall, but perfectly fitted for this configuration and within budget.

{{< markdowning >}} 

A great choice if you want a fast and performing SSD but are not willing to spend a lot of money. It has a similar performance and reliability as the Samsung 860 EVO, but at a substantially lower pricepoint. Only downside is the somewhat dull design

{{< markdowning >}} 

When it comes to choosing a case, a lot depends on personal taste and preferences. For this build we opted for a more flashy case with a tempered glass cover. It's a solid (and big) case, with ammple space and 3 cool RGB ventilators

## Prebuilt Gaming PC Under 400 Dollars {class="content-body-label"}

{{< htmlclass3 "content-body-section" >}}

If you're not really into building your own PC there are some pretty good prebuilt gaming PC options available. A prebuilt with similar specifications will be more expensive, but saves you the hassle (and the fun) of putting all parts together. It will work just fine out of the box.


{{< alternativebox "HP Pavillion Gaming Desktop" "hp_pavillion" "HP Pavillion" "$397.41" "#" "Check current price">}}
A great entry level gaming computer. You might want to upgrade the RAM though, 4GB is at the lower end.

### CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 3600X {class="icons-cpu"}
{{< /markdowning >}} 

{{< pclass "content-body-h3subtitle" >}}
Best All-Round Value CPU
{{< /pclass >}}

{{< pclass "content-body-speclist" >}}
**Cores:** 6 | **Threads:** 12 | **Base Clock:** 3.6 Ghz | **Boost Clock:** 4.2 Ghz |**L3 Cache:** 2x16 MB | **TDP:** 65W | **Socket:** AM4 |

{{< imgresponsive "amd-ryzen-5-3600" "AMD Ryzen 5 3600X" />}}

{{< body-summary-json  "Cooler included, Overclocking , Quiet, Great value" "No integrated GPU" "0730143309936">}}

{{< markdowning >}} 
The AMD Ryzen 5 3600 offers a huge improvement on performance compared to the Ryzen 3 3200G. It's comparable to the Intel Core i5-9600K in terms of performance, but at a much lower price point. This upgrade comes with a caveat however: this CPU doesn't include a Graphics Card, so you will need to add one as well, increasing the total cost of this build. If you want top notch gaming performance on high-end AAA video games this CPU will be a choice you won't regret.

## Peripherals {class="content-body-label"}

Having a gaming PC is a nice start, but unfortunately the spending doesn't end there; If you want to run this system, you'll need a display, keyboard, mouse and an operating system. 

{{< htmlclass3 "content-body-section" >}} 

{{< markdowning >}} 
### Operating system: Windows 10 {class="icons-winos"}
{{< /markdowning >}} 

{{< pclass "content-body-h3subtitle" >}}
Still the most convenient and user-friendly OS for gaming
{{< /pclass >}}


{{< imgresponsive "windows10" ">Windows 10" />}}

{{< body-summary  "Loading time, Reliable , Directx 12 for high frame rates" "Annoying updates at inconvenient times" "$ 139" "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/b/windows" >}}

{{< markdowning >}} 
While Linux is a valid option, for most users Windows 10 is the best option. If you already have a licence on another PC you can transfer this licence to your new PC without issues. The licence shouldn't necessary be a Windows 10 licence, you can get a free upgrade on your Windows 7 or 8 licence.

If you're student, you can get a Windows 10 Educution licence for free. Even better it's yours to keep even if you graduate. Condition: You must be enrolled in an eligible school.

If you're on a very tight budget you can install Windows 10 and don't activate it. Main downside is a watermark in the bottom right of the corner. You won't be able to change Personalization options in the settings menu and you will obviously get no support from Windows in case of Problems.

Various resellers are selling Windows licences at prices much lower than the official price charged by Microsoft. Kinguin has multiple seller offering Windows Licences for as low as $ 29.99 . While they claim these licences are genuine, and are bought from wholesalers with a surplus of Licences, there is always a risk. Best option in that case is to add the Buyer protection to your purchase. It will cost you a bit more but it's 100% money back guarantee if the licence key isn't working.

Regardless via which channel you purchased your licence, if it's valid you're entitled to Microsoft Support in case of technical problems.

### Monitor: MSI Optix MAG241C {class="icons-monitor"}
{{< /markdowning >}} 

{{< pclass "content-body-h3subtitle" >}}
The best gaming monitor for less than $100
{{< /pclass >}}

{{< body-summary-json  "Great value for money, 60Hz refresh rate" "Don't expect too much from speakers, Colours could be more accurate" "0610839326068">}}

{{< markdowning >}} 
This Asus VE228H Gaming Monitor is a great entry-level 1080p monitor for an unbeatable price. The display quality is amazing, with great color contrast. Hardcore gamers would probably go for a 144Hz monitor, but for this build the 60Hz refresh rate will do just fine. The response time is 5ms is not best in class, but well enough for a 60Hz refresh rate. You will be able to play your favorite games without blurring or ghosting.

Ok - this is not a mechanical keyboard. But it is a great keyboard for its price: if feels great, key strokes are smooth are smooth and responsive. It has adjustable lighting patterns, 3 different profiles that allow customising for games. Looks nice, has good build quality, what more could you want for this price

### Mouse: Logitech G203 Prodigy {class="icons-mouse"}
{{< /markdowning >}} 
Suprising good gaming mouse given its price

{{< markdowning >}} 
A great affordable mouse. The 8000 DPI sensor is very accurate (and can be adjusted in increments of 50). It feels solid (although quite small if you have bigger hands). The ideal compnaion for this budget build.

### Sound: Creative Pebble  {class="icons-sound"}
{{< /markdowning >}} 

{{< pclass "content-body-h3subtitle" >}}
Tiny speakers with incredible sound
{{< /pclass >}}

{{< pclass "content-body-speclist" >}}
**Configuration:** 2.0 | **Power:** 2.2 W | **Total Wattage:** 4.4 W | **Frequency Response:** 100 Hz - 17 kHZ |  **Color:** Black

{{< body-summary-json  "Rich Sound, Incredible Price, Tiny Footprint" "No bluetooth" "0097855123152">}}

{{< markdowning >}} 
There is a lot of competition in the sub-30$ speaker range, but the Creative Pebble speakers really jump out. It has a full and balanced that normally only comes with speakers twice this price. As far as music is concerned, they can handle every style. But even for gaming they're surprisingly good. Ok, it's a 2.0 system, so you're not going to get a full surround effect, but they will just be fine for most of the games you play.

### Headset: HyperX Cloud Stinger {class="icons-headset"}
{{< /markdowning >}} 

{{< pclass "content-body-h3subtitle" >}}

{{< body-summary-json  "Unbeatable price, Very comfortable" "Microphone quality, Bass could be stronger" "0740617295467">}}

{{< markdowning >}} 
HyperX is one of the top Gaming Headsets manufacturers. Their entry-level model Cloud Stinger looks great but not really exceptional. While sound and microphone and not really top of class, they are extremely comfortable. Important as you'll be probably wearing them for a few hours while gaming. Sound is good in the mid-range but both bass and high-end could be a little bit more accentuated. The microphone will be do what's required, but it will not filter out all background noises and you voice may be a little deformed. Nothing your teammates will really complain about. Overall, best gaming headset in this pricerange.
