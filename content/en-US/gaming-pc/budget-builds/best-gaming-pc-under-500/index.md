Like with the [$400 build](/gaming-pc/budget-builds/best-gaming-pc-under-400/ "Gaming PC build under 300$"), it's not easy to get a good gaming machine with a limited budget of $500 budget. We wanted this build to be the entry point for 1080p gaming, at reasonable frame rates. For this build, we used the AMD Ryzen 5 2600, the predecessor of the AMD Ryzen 5 3600 we're using for our [$600 build](/gaming-pc/budget-builds/best-gaming-pc-under-600/ "Gaming PC build under 600$"). It's a bit cheaper as the newer version, but only slightly less performing. Unlike the AMD Ryzen 3 3200G, it doesn't feature a build-in Graphics cards, so we opted for a basic but extremely well performing Graphics card, based on the great RX 570 chip set.

## Build Considerations {class="content-body-label"}

{{< htmlclass "content-body-section"  >}}

With a budget of $500 you can get a very decent gaming computer, that can easily beat the top game consoles. However it's not the budget that allows a lot of fancy stuff. 

**Budget** - In order to order to stick to the budget some compromises needed to be made. We put most of our budget on the processor and the graphics card. The other components are not fancy but will do the job. We choose a no-frills motherboard and limited the capacity of both the SSD and internal memory. If you have some money to spare, increasing the SSD to 500GB and memory to 16GB would be a good idea for a smoother gaming experience. The case is functional but very basic, as it has no impact on gaming performance we focused on user-friendly for first time builders, not on aesthetics.


**Performance** - This build will allow you to play AAA games with at least high settings at decent frame rates of 60fps+ 
It will handle all your favorite games, in 1080p. You will only have to compromise on settings when playing the latest, most demanding games like Red Dead Redemption 2. Here you will probably have to lower the settings to a mixture of mid/high settings to maintain a 60fps in most areas.to run on with a mixture of mid/high settings to maintain 60fps in most areas.

**AMD vs Intel** - 

Why did we choose AMD rather than Intel for this build. We have multiple reasons for that. First of all, Intel is still the more expensive of the two, an important consideration when you have to stick to a limited budget. AMD processors are overclockable and include a good cooler. Intels cooler is pretty flimsy and they charge a premium for overclocking. In terms of value, AMD is the clear winner. 

Second, from a performance standpoint, while Intel is still leading in the higher price ranges, for more budget builds like this the difference in performance between the two is quite limited. 

Last point is upgradeability. AMD has made some smart choices regarding upgrades with their Socket AM4 motherboards, supporting both backward and forward compatibility, so you can reuse your motherboard when upgrading your processor.

## Build Details {class="content-body-label"}

Let's check each of the components used to build this budget 300 $ gaming system.


{{< builddetails "products" >}} 

{{< htmlclass3 "content-body-section" >}} 
{{< markdowning >}} 
### CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 2600 Processor {class="icons-cpu"}
{{< /markdowning >}} 

{{< pclass "content-body-h3subtitle" >}}
Great multi core CPU that handles tasks with a breeze

{{< body-summary-json  "Great value for price, Overclocking , Integrated Cooling" "No integrated GPU " "0730143309165">}}

{{< markdowning >}} 

Although this processor is currently being replaced by the Ryzen 5 3600, this processor is still amazing in handling everything you throw at it: gaming, streaming and pretty much anything else. At its current price level it simply can't be beaten in terms of price versus performance.

### MOBO: MSI B450M PRO-M2 MAX {class="icons-motherboard"}

{{< /markdowning >}}
{{< pclass "content-body-h3subtitle" >}}
A lot of value for an inexpensive board
{{< /pclass >}}

{{< markdowning >}} 

While the motherboard is probably not the most important part for a gaming build, you can't really go wrong choosing this motherboard. For a price under $80, it comes with overclocking support and supports AMD CPU's from all generations (even the latest 3rd Gen CPU's are supported out of the box). You won't have issues upgrading your PC with this board. It allows up to 64 GB of RAM, and speeds up to 3466+Hz, so no issues here to find the ideal match for the Ryzen 5 3600 processor used in this build. It's not the best motherboard overall, but perfectly fitted for this configuration and within budget.

### SSD: ADATA SU635 {class="icons-hdd"}

{{< /markdowning >}}
{{< pclass "content-body-h3subtitle" >}}
Entry level SSD - best bang for buck
{{< /pclass >}}

{{< pclass "content-body-speclist" >}}

{{< body-summary-json  "Easy to install, Great Value" "Not the fastest SSD, Reliability issues, Gets very warm" "4713218461162">}}

{{< markdowning >}} 

THe ADATA SU635 is not the fastest SSD in terms of performance, but it still a lot a faster compared with a more traditional HDD. 240GB will be sufficient - a capacity of 500GB would be better but didn't fit in the tight budget of this build.

### Case: Thermaltake Versa H21 {class="icons-case"}

{{< /markdowning >}}
{{< pclass "content-body-h3subtitle" >}}
Sleek and elegant

{{< body-summary-json  "Ample space, Changeable front panel , Cable Routing" "Top ventilation without dust filter, Thin material" "4717964394439">}}

{{< markdowning >}} 

It's not the most fancy case, but it serves its purpose. It's big enough to fit all components, and cable management shouldn't pose any problem.

## What games can you play on this PC? {class="content-body-label"}

{{< htmlclass "content-body-section" >}}

This gaming built will meets the minimum requirements of the following games.   
* Counter-Strike: Global Offensive
* Dota 2 
* Fortnite
* Rocket League
* Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege
* PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds 
* Overwatch
* Warframe
* GTA V
* Forza Horizon 4 
* Monster Hunter: World
* Hitman 2 
* The Witcher 3
* Total War: Warhammer II
* PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds

Most of them can be played on 60FPS in 1080p - for Fortnite 100FPS should be easily achieved. Even more demanding titles like 'Monster Hunter: World' would still perform quite well at 60FPS. Contrary to our $300 build, PUBG becomes playable, although you really should not expect a good gaming experience. For better overall gaming performance, even for more demanding games you should check out the [$500 build](/gaming-pc/budget-builds/best-gaming-pc-under-500/ "Best Gaming PC build under $500")

## Prebuilt Gaming PC Under 400 Dollars {class="content-body-label"}

{{< htmlclass3 "content-body-section" >}}

If you're not really into building your own PC there are some pretty good prebuilt gaming PC options available. A prebuilt with similar specifications will be more expensive, but saves you the hassle (and the fun) of putting all parts together. It will work just fine out of the box.


{{< alternativebox "HP Pavillion Gaming Desktop" "hp_pavillion" "HP Pavillion" "$397.41" "#" "Check current price">}}
A great entry level gaming computer. You might want to upgrade the RAM though, 4GB is at the lower end.
{{< /alternativebox >}}

{{< /htmlclass3  >}}

{{< body-summary-json  "8GB GDDR5 VRAM, Overclocking , Quiet" "Noisy fans at full speed" "4719072548438">}}

{{< markdowning >}} 
With 8GB of video memory this card will allow to play your high-end video games at the highest possible settings in 1080p and still maintain a decent frame rate. This graphics card will bring a huge performance boost to this build. Performance is close to GPU's in a much higher price range.

### CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 3600 {class="icons-cpu"}
{{< /markdowning >}} 

{{< pclass "content-body-h3subtitle" >}}
Best All-Round Value CPU
{{< /pclass >}}

{{< pclass "content-body-speclist" >}}
**Cores:** 6 | **Threads:** 12 | **Base Clock:** 3.6 Ghz | **Boost Clock:** 4.2 Ghz |**L3 Cache:** 2x16 MB | **TDP:** 65W | **Socket:** AM4 |

{{< body-summary-json  "Cooler included, Overclocking , Quiet, Great value" "No integrated GPU" "0730143309936">}}

{{< markdowning >}} 
The AMD Ryzen 5 3600 offers a huge improvement on performance compared to the Ryzen 3 3200G. It's comparable to the Intel Core i5-9600K in terms of performance, but at a much lower price point. This upgrade comes with a caveat however: this CPU doesn't include a Graphics Card, so you will need to add one as well, increasing the total cost of this build. If you want top notch gaming performance on high-end AAA video games this CPU will be a choice you won't regret.

## Peripherals {class="content-body-label"}

Having a gaming PC is a nice start, but unfortunately the spending doesn't end there; If you want to run this system, you'll need a display, keyboard, mouse and an operating system. 

{{< htmlclass3 "content-body-section" >}} 

{{< markdowning >}} 
### Operating system: Windows 10 {class="icons-winos"}
{{< /markdowning >}} 

{{< pclass "content-body-h3subtitle" >}}
Still the most convenient and user-friendly OS for gaming
{{< /pclass >}}


{{< imgresponsive "windows10" ">Windows 10" />}}

{{< body-summary  "Loading time, Reliable , Directx 12 for high frame rates" "Annoying updates at inconvenient times" "$ 139" "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/b/windows" >}}

{{< markdowning >}} 
While Linux is a valid option, for most users Windows 10 is the best option. If you already have a licence on another PC you can transfer this licence to your new PC without issues. The licence shouldn't necessary be a Windows 10 licence, you can get a free upgrade on your Windows 7 or 8 licence.

If you're student, you can get a Windows 10 Educution licence for free. Even better it's yours to keep even if you graduate. Condition: You must be enrolled in an eligible school.

If you're on a very tight budget you can install Windows 10 and don't activate it. Main downside is a watermark in the bottom right of the corner. You won't be able to change Personalization options in the settings menu and you will obviously get no support from Windows in case of Problems.

Various resellers are selling Windows licences at prices much lower than the official price charged by Microsoft. Kinguin has multiple seller offering Windows Licences for as low as $ 29.99 . While they claim these licences are genuine, and are bought from wholesalers with a surplus of Licences, there is always a risk. Best option in that case is to add the Buyer protection to your purchase. It will cost you a bit more but it's 100% money back guarantee if the licence key isn't working.

Regardless via which channel you purchased your licence, if it's valid you're entitled to Microsoft Support in case of technical problems.

### Monitor: Asus VE228H {class="icons-monitor"}
{{< /markdowning >}} 

{{< pclass "content-body-h3subtitle" >}}
The best gaming monitor for less than $100
{{< /pclass >}}

{{< markdowning >}} 
This Asus VE228H Gaming Monitor is a great entry-level 1080p monitor for an unbeatable price. The display quality is amazing, with great color contrast. Hardcore gamers would probably go for a 144Hz monitor, but for this build the 60Hz refresh rate will do just fine. The response time is 5ms is not best in class, but well enough for a 60Hz refresh rate. You will be able to play your favorite games without blurring or ghosting.

Ok - this is not a mechanical keyboard. But it is a great keyboard for its price: if feels great, key strokes are smooth are smooth and responsive. It has adjustable lighting patterns, 3 different profiles that allow customising for games. Looks nice, has good build quality, what more could you want for this price

{{< markdowning >}} 
A great affordable mouse. The 8000 DPI sensor is very accurate (and can be adjusted in increments of 50). It feels solid (although quite small if you have bigger hands). The ideal compnaion for this budget build.

{{< markdowning >}} 
There is a lot of competition in the sub-30$ speaker range, but the Creative Pebble speakers really jump out. It has a full and balanced that normally only comes with speakers twice this price. As far as music is concerned, they can handle every style. But even for gaming they're surprisingly good. Ok, it's a 2.0 system, so you're not going to get a full surround effect, but they will just be fine for most of the games you play.

{{< body-summary-json  "Unbeatable price, Very comfortable" "Microphone quality, Bass could be stronger" "0740617295467">}}

{{< markdowning >}} 
HyperX is one of the top Gaming Headsets manufacturers. Their entry-level model Cloud Stinger looks great but not really exceptional. While sound and microphone and not really top of class, they are extremely comfortable. Important as you'll be probably wearing them for a few hours while gaming. Sound is good in the mid-range but both bass and high-end could be a little bit more accentuated. The microphone will be do what's required, but it will not filter out all background noises and you voice may be a little deformed. Nothing your teammates will really complain about. Overall, best gaming headset in this pricerange.
